# Schreiberling
Schreiberling is a distraction free markdown editor made to write without being annoyed of things that are in the way while you're typing.

Schreiberling gives you a clear writing feeling. It feels like writing on a white piece of paper when writing on Schreiberling's white interface. When writing with Schreiberling, there is nothing more than you, your text and a very nice and clean interface with a menu bar at the top.

Everything in Schreiberling can be customized. You like line numbers? Activate them! You don't want to have a menu bar? Disable it! You normally do all and everything with shortcuts? No problem! And if there is anything, Schreiberling can't do, feel free to code it yourself. Schreiberling runs modern web languages like HTML and Javascript and is completely open source. It comes with a nice plugin API to write your own plugins - and if that is not enough: Just help us to make Schreiberling better!

All features of Schreiberling in one list:

* Distraction free writing
* Completely customizable
* Plugin API

Yes - it is not more. But ask yourself: Do you really need more? We do not and that's what Schreiberling is: All you need.
